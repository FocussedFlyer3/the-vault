## Exceptions Handling with JavaScript

In a flawed world, there is no such thing as flawless code. Even if there was, there is odd to be a person who will find ways to break what seemed to be a flawless code. Is there a way we can prevent or control this? Let me introduce you to the `try/catch` block statements in JavaScript.

> When the code runs into an unexpected problem, the JavaScript idiomatic way to handle this situation is through exceptions.

There are errors that will occur during a programâ€™s runtime and exceptions will be raised. If theyâ€™re not properly caught and handled, it might crash the program itself. Usually, this is something all developers want to avoid, as it provides a bad user experience to the users. The way to better handle those exceptions is with a `try/catch` block.

```javascript
try {
     // lines of code that might throw exceptions
} catch (error) {
     // here is where you handle those exceptions more gracefully
}
```

With this, any exceptions occur within the try block will be gracefully handled and catch by the catch block.  

We can take this one step further with a finally statement, which usually provides a way to close and clean up any remaining opened resources, like files or network requests. It runs regardless of whether an error occurs or it was handled or not. 

```javascript
try {
	// lines of code that might throw exceptions
} catch (error) {
	// here is where you handle those exceptions more gracefully
} finally {
    // code here runs regardless what happens previously
}
```

We can even use the finally statement without the catch block.

```javascript
try {
	// lines of code that might throw exceptions
} finally {
	// code here runs regardless what happens previously
}
```

Just like if-else statements, we can nest the `try/catch` block as well.

```javascript
try {
	// lines of code that might throw exceptions

	try {
		// other lines of code that might throw exceptions
	} finally {
		// code here runs regardless what happens previously
	}

} catch (error) {
	// here is where you handle those exceptions more gracefully
}
```
Hmm, you might be wondering, since there isnâ€™t a catch statement in the inner `try/finally` block, how are the exceptions being handled? 

Any exceptions that occur in the inner try block, it will be handled in the outer catch block, that way we only need a catch statement at the outermost try/catch block. 

THATâ€™S IT ðŸ¥³

Now with the try/catch block, you can rest assured that your application will not crash ungracefully. It will provide a much better user experience overall. Do you use the `try/catch` block to handle errors more gracefully? Let me know in the comments below!
